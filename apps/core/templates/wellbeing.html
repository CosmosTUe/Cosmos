In the first few weeks student mentors will meet weekly with their group of first year students, and as time goes on the frequency will depend on the important topics to be discussed with first year students.

The student counsellor can advise you, act as an intermediary, or refer you. Even if you donâ€™t know exactly what the matter is, it is often useful to have a conversation with a relative outsider. Gaining insight into a problematic situation can help clear things up. For example, study grants, financial support due to study delay, enrolment, postponement of the BSA etc.</p>
