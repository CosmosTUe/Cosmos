        <p>
            The Common Room naturally arose as a living room in “De Bunker” on Thursday October 21st 2010 by a diverse
            group of TU/e international students. International students back at that time realized there was a lack of
            places of social interaction for them and also it was relatively difficult to integrate in the Dutch student
            culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later in 2012, two of the founding students proposed to the university to establish an international student
            association. The proposal got the university’s approval.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting from February 1st 2013, the Common Room moved to the MetaForum building on the TU/e campus. As of
            now, this is the current home-base for the Cosmos association.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ever since the beginning, and through the increased internationalization of the university until today,
            Cosmos has been at the forefront of providing a space, a voice, and a family to our members and those part
            of our community.
